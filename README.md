# DSS Emissions Page

This HTML page provides information about emissions related to fires. It highlights the gases directly released into the atmosphere during fire events.

The data presented on this page is sourced from the Â© European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) | Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS).

## Emitted Gases

Fires can release various gases into the atmosphere, including:

1. Carbon Dioxide (CO2): The primary greenhouse gas emitted during the combustion of biomass (vegetation) in wildfires. It contributes to global warming.

2. Carbon Monoxide (CO): Produced as a byproduct of incomplete combustion of organic materials during fires. CO is a toxic gas and can affect air quality in areas near the fire.

3. Sulfur Dioxide (SO2): Produced when fires burn materials containing sulfur, such as chemically treated wood. SO2 can cause respiratory issues and contribute to smog formation.

4. Nitrogen Oxides (NOx): Generated during high-temperature combustion in fires, especially when nitrogen-rich fuels like fertilizers or abundant vegetation are present. NOx contributes to smog formation and can have negative impacts on air quality and human health.

5. Particulate Matter: Fires produce fine particles (PM2.5) and coarse particles (PM10) consisting of ash, soot, and other carbonaceous materials. These particles can be transported over long distances, affecting air quality and posing risks to respiratory health.

Please note that the exact composition of gases emitted by fires can vary depending on the burning materials and specific fire conditions. Additionally, fires can also release other volatile organic compounds and chemicals, which may have adverse effects on air quality and the environment.
